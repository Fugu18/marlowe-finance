### Marlowe 2025: Oracle Protocol, Design and Implementation

This is one of a set of proposals that together consolidate the Marlowe infrastructure and improve the developer experience, enhance Marlowe with an innovative oracle protocol, developed in collaboration with leading Cardano oracle providers, and design the successor core language, Marlowe V2, working with the Marlowe developer ecosystem.

### TxPipe Marlowe Decentralized Oracle Integration

Integrates the existing Marlowe Runtime with feeds from well-known decentralized oracles in the Cardano ecosystem, such as [Charli3](https://charli3.io/)

### TxPipe Marlowe Runtime SDKs

Idiomatic SDKs in Rust, Python, Go and Javascript to easily interact with Marlowe Runtime. This will facilitate adoption of the framework by developers in the ecosystem.

### Marlowe Next Integration

Tool stack enable developers to build reliable and cost-effective Dapps. The REST endpoints follow an OpenAPI specification, and it is recommended to use the TypeScript SDK for communication. The TypeScript SDK serves as a wrapper for the OpenAPI specification, providing additional logic that facilitates the creation and execution of smart contracts, acting as a bridge between the Marlowe runtime and the web application.
